            <p class="description" style="align-content: left">Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants, or mobile phones. These
applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms or delivered as web
applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an
&quot;application-like&quot; experience within a Web browser. 
Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware
specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes
within each of the platforms.
As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also essential in the
creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI considers constraints, contexts, screen, input, and mobility as
outlines for design </p>

            <h4 class="title"><a href="">Software development</a></h4>
            <p class="description" style="align-content: left">Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming,
documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications,
frameworks, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and
maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the
conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes
in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development may include research, new
development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other
activities that result in software products. 
The need for better quality control of the software development process has given rise to the
discipline of software engineering, which aims to apply the systematic approach exemplified in
the engineering paradigm to the process of software development.
There are many approaches to software project management, known as software development
life cycle models, methodologies, processes, or models. The waterfall model is a traditional
version, contrasted with the more recent innovation of agile software development.</p>

            <h4 class="title"><a href="">Web Development </a></h4>
            <p class="description" style="align-content: left">Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide
Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple
single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social

network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly
refers may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-
commerce development.
Among Web professionals, &quot;web development&quot; usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management
systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of
people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while
developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting
developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or
information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between
departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web
developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while
back-end developers deal with the servers. </p>

            <h4 class="title"><a href="">Project Development </a></h4>
            <p class="description" style="align-content: left">Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals
within the given constraints. This information is usually described in project documentation,
created at the beginning of the development process. The primary constraints are scope, time,
budget. The secondary challenge is to optimize the allocation of necessary inputs and apply them
to meet pre-defined objectives.
The objective of project management is to produce a complete project which complies with the
client&#39;s objectives. In many cases, the objective of project management is also to shape or reform
the client&#39;s brief to feasibly address the client&#39;s objectives. Once the client&#39;s objectives are
established, they should influence all decisions made by other people involved in the project –
for example, project managers, designers, and contractors. Ill-defined or too tightly prescribed
project management objectives are detrimental to decision making.
A project is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service, or result with a
defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or
staffing) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial
change or added value. The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with business as usual
(or operations), which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to
produce products or services. In practice, the management of such distinct production approaches
requires the development of distinct technical skills and management strategies.</p>

            <p class="description" style="align-content: left">Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new — or modify
existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and
market requirements. This reimagining of business in the digital age is digital transformation.
It transcends traditional roles like sales, marketing, and customer service. Instead, digital
transformation begins and ends with how you think about, and engage with, customers. As we
move from paper to spreadsheets to smart applications for managing our business, we have the
chance to reimagine how we do business — how we engage our customers — with digital
technology on our side.
For small businesses just getting started, there’s no need to set up your business processes and
transform them later. You can future-proof your organization from the word go. Building a 21st-
century business on stickies and handwritten ledgers just isn’t sustainable. Thinking, planning
and building digitally sets you up to be agile, flexible, and ready to grow.
As they embark on digital transformation, many companies are taking a step back to ask whether
they are doing the right things. Read on for answers. </p>

            <p class="description" style="align-content: left">Business analytics, a data management solution and business intelligence subset, refers to the use
of methodologies such as data mining, predictive analytics, and statistical analysis to analyze and
transform data into useful information, identify and anticipate trends and outcomes, and
ultimately make smarter, data-driven business decisions.
The main components of a typical business analytics dashboard include:
 Data Aggregation: before analysis, data must first be gathered, organized, and filtered,
either through volunteered data or transactional records
 Data Mining: data mining for business analytics sorts through large datasets using
databases, statistics, and machine learning to identify trends and establish relationships
 Association and Sequence Identification: the identification of predictable actions that are
performed in association with other actions or sequentially 
 Text Mining: explores and organizes large, unstructured text datasets for qualitative and
quantitative analysis
 Forecasting: analyzes historical data from a specific period to make informed estimates
that are predictive in determining future events or behaviors
 Predictive Analytics: predictive business analytics uses a variety of statistical techniques
to create predictive models, which extract information from datasets, identify patterns,
and provide a predictive score for an array of organizational outcomes
 Optimization: once trends have been identified and predictions have been made,
businesses can engage simulation techniques to test out best-case scenarios
 Data Visualization: provides visual representations such as charts and graphs for easy and
quick data analysis</p>

            <h4 class="title"><a href="">Project and portfolio services</a></h4>
            <p class="description" style="align-content: left">Project portfolio management (PPM) refers to a process used by project managers and project
management organizations (PMOs) to analyze the potential return on undertaking a project. By
organizing and consolidating every piece of data regarding proposed and current projects, project
portfolio managers provide forecasting and business analysis for companies looking to invest in
new projects.
 
The main benefits of project portfolio management are:
1. It provides alignment between company objectives and projects
